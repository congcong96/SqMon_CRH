% rx is between 0 and 1, where 0 implies the strf

% calculated for different octave shifts.

% xshift : number of octave bin shifts for which r is calculated.

%    represents a -2.0, -1.75, ..., 1.75, or 2.0 octave shift.
%    A shift of zero is not included.

% rf : strf matrix
%
% deltax : difference, in octaves, between frequency samples of strf
